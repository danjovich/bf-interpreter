# bf-interpreter
A brainf**k interpreter written in C.

## Running
To run, simply clone the repository and run the following bash command in the root folder,
replacing `filepath` with the path to a brainfuck file:

```bash
make run FILE=filepath
```

Obviously, you must have make and gcc installed to run it this way.
